# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

My first application with ReactJS, it's a simple tic-tac-toe game with time travel (allows to return any move in a match).
This project was built for educational purposes and personal study. The goal is to learn and practice concepts of the framework.

This project was initialized with Vite and the logical part of the game was built with React documentarion help.
